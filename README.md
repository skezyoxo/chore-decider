Turtle Race Chore Decider
Overview
The Turtle Race Chore Decider is an interactive program that determines who has to do a chore through a turtle race. The program uses the turtle module to create a race between three turtles, each representing a different colour: red, green, and blue. Two players place their bets on which turtle will win the race, and the losing player(s) must perform a chore.

Features
User Interaction: Players input their bets on which turtle will win and specify a chore for the loser(s).
Turtle Graphics: The race is visually displayed using turtle graphics, with each turtle moving randomly towards the finish line.
Result Display: The program announces the winner and assigns the chore to the losing player(s).
Installation
Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Turtle Module: The turtle module is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is needed.

Usage
Clone this repository or copy the code into a Python file (e.g., turtle_race.py).

Run the Python file:
python turtle_race.py

Follow the prompts to:
Enter the names of the players.
Place bets on which turtle (red, green, blue) will win the race.
